# Analysis Question
1. What is the relationship between success rate of space missions and country, launch year, and prices?
2. What is the trend of mission success year by year?

# Issue
- Price data in Year before 1964 is unavailable, therefore analyze data with price will have less data that other fields
- Last set in location is refer to country, but some location is in a sea or set as other place (need to google and set value)
- A lot of information (refer to Graph6) that display relationship between success rate,country and year. Therefore author using GIF file to display year by year

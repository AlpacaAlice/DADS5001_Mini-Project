# Dataset Information
File Name: space_missions.csv <br/>
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/space-missions <br/>
Total:
- 4630 Rows
- 9 Columns
   - Company
   - Location 
   - Date 
   - Time
   - Rocket
   - Mission
   - RocketStatus
   - Price 
   - MissionStatus 

# Analysis Question
1. What is the relationship between success rate of space missions and country, launch year, and prices?
2. What is the trend of mission success year by year?

# Issue
- Price data in year before 1964 is unavailable. Consequently, analyzing data with price will have fewer data points than other fields. 
- Last set in location refers to country, but some locations are in the sea or set as other places (need to google and set value) 
- A lot of information (refer to Graph6) that displays the relationship between success rate, country, and year. As a result, the author employs a GIF file to display the years one by one.
